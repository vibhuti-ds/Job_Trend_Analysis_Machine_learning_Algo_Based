# Job Trend Analysis Machine learning Algorithums 
---
A machine learning-powered project built to analyze real-time job listing data from **Naukri.com**, this model predicts a candidate’s **expected pay grade** based on their profile. It includes full data cleaning, EDA, model training with multiple algorithms, and a **user-friendly web dashboard** built using HTML and CSS.

---

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to:
- Analyze job market trends across India.
- Study how various features (like qualification, stream, location, role, company type) affect salary.
- Predict the expected **salary/pay grade** based on a candidate’s profile.
- Build a dashboard interface where users can enter their profile and instantly get a salary prediction.

---

## Data Source

  - Data collected through web scraping of job listings including:
  - `job_title`, `experience_required`, `location`, `salary`, `qualification`, `stream`, `industry`, `company_type`, etc.
-

---

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Scraping & Storage
- Used `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` to extract job listings from Naukri.com.
- Stored in a CSV with over 5,000+ rows and 15+ features.

---

### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed nulls and duplicates
- Standardized string formats (e.g., "B.Tech", "B. Tech", etc.)
- Converted categorical features into numerical using:
  - Label Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding
- Converted salary range strings to mean numeric value
- Extracted and converted experience like `2-5 years` → `mean = 3.5`

---

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized:
  - Top-paying cities
  - Salary trends per industry
  - Role vs Pay Grade
  - Qualification vs Salary
- Charts used:
  - Bar plots, Box plots, Heatmaps, Distribution plots

---

### Step 4: Model Training
- Models used:
  1. **Linear Regression** → For predicting numeric pay grade
  2. **Logistic Regression** → For classifying into low/medium/high salary group
  3. **Decision Tree** → For both regression & classification tasks

- Split: `Train 80% / Test 20%`
- Metrics:
  - For regression: `R² Score`, `RMSE`
  - For classification: `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `F1-score`

 Models saved using `joblib` or `pickle` in the `/models/` directory.

---

### Step 5: Front-End Dashboard (HTML/CSS)

- Form inputs for:
  - Qualification
  - Stream/Specialization
  - City
  - Company Type (Startup, MNC, Public, etc.)
  - Desired Role/Post

 On submission, the model predicts the **expected pay grade** (e.g., ₹6.5 LPA).
